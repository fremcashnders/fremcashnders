Loan requirements should not be the only consideration for people considering a payday loan. In terms of annual percentage rates, it is not uncommon for payday loans to exceed 500% or even 1,000%. Even though business models and regulations limit the size and duration of payday loans, these types of loans are still an expensive alternative and should be undertaken with care.

Because of the high interest rates, payday loans are the most expensive way to borrow money. Some states have laws regulating how much payday lenders can lend and how much they can charge for loans, while other states, like New York, ban the practice altogether.8 In those states where the practice is banned, lenders often circumvent the regulations by partnering with banks in other states.
