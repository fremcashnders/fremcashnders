Feedom Cash Lenders

Payday loans are illegal in 18 states—Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Vermont, and West Virginia—and the District of Columbia. Rates are capped in many other states.

Payday loans are not reported to any of the three major credit bureaus, so they will not lower or raise your credit score directly. However, if you fail to repay your loan, the lender can send your loan to collections. The collections agency may report the debt to the credit agency, which could lower your score.
