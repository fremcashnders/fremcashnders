Qualifying loan amounts vary depending on the borrowerâ€™s income and the payday lender, although most states have laws establishing maximum payday loan amounts. Some states even limit the ability of borrowers to have multiple outstanding payday loans to keep consumers from borrowing large amounts at extremely high interest rates. Depending on state law, loan amounts can vary from $50 to $1,000.
